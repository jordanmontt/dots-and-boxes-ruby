# dots-and-boxes-ruby

This is a project in which we use cucumber and capybara do to a test driven development project. We test the interaction of the real user with the UI of the application. 

The application is a game called: Dots and Boxes in which 2 to 5 players are competing to do a closed square with sticks. It is a web application built with Sinatra.

To run the project:

First, install the gems with:

```bash
sudo bundle install
```

To run the Sinatra app:

```bash
ruby app.rb
```
